## Folder Description

This folder contains all the supporting base GCP infrastructure sepecifically for the demo. This includes GCP Project configuration and base networking. 

Under normal operating environment it would be assumed that the time-keeper GCP organisation would already be provisioned and that this content would not fully be required to provision as part of the "Migration to GKE" requirements.
